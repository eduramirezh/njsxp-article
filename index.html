	<h1>Analysis of real experiences with Node.js</h1>
	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>Node.js is a software platform for building scalable network applications. This research looks at different experiences implementing solutions with this tool. Based on the experiences and comments of experts from companies such as Yahoo!, LinkedIn, The New York Times and others, it will show different aspects of deployments with this tool from scratch as well as migrations from other software. There is special emphasis on the <i>Yahoo!</i> case.  </p>
	<h2>Context</h2>
	<h3>What is Node.js?</h3>
	<p>Node.js is a server-side JavaScript environment that enables real-time web applications to scale by using asynchronous event-driven model. Node.js uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine to run its JavaScript. Node.js is the hottest technology used in many production environments including LinkedIn, PayPal, Walmart, Yahoo! and eBay.</p>
	<p>As described in their website <a href="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org/</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</blockquote>
	<p>Its initial release was in 2009 and since then it has experienced and explosive adoption by the developers community. </p>
	<h3>Popularity</h3>
	<p>As of November 2013, statistics on GitHub show the <a href='https://github.com/joyent/node'>Node.js repository</a> as the third most popular project, right after Twitter's bootstrap and JQuery. In 2011 it surpassed Ruby on Rails, then the most popular repo.</p>
	<p>This also meant an increase in the popularity of Javascript in open source projects. This next charts represent the most popular languages on Github repos for 2010 and 2013</p>

	<h2>Real experiences</h2>
	<p>Node.js is a new tool. Its current version is 0.10.22, meaning it hasn't released a <i>v 1.0</i> version yet. However, this hasn't prevent big companies for using it in its products. The official site shows <a href="http://nodejs.org/industry/"> a list of them</a>, and they go from start-ups like Learnboost.com to big, consolidated companies like Yahoo! and LinkedIn. The discussed reasons for using Node are different for them, as there are different implications for migrations to Node, mainly beacause of performance needs, to start new projects using it, where the main reasons are more related to developers skills and preferences too.</p>
	<h3>Why Node?</h3>
	<p>There seems to be three main reasons companies are basing their option to go with Node: Scalability, Real-time scenarios and end-to-end Javascript. When asked about the reasons why they did a complete deployment for the server side of their mobile app in Node.js, LinkedIn’s mobile development lead Kiran Prasad said: </p>
	<blockquote>
“On the server side, our entire mobile software stack is completely built in Node. We use a ton of technologies at LinkedIn, but for the mobile server piece, it’s entirely Node-based.
	One reason was scale. The second is, if you look at Node, the thing it’s best at doing is talking to other services. The mobile app has to talk to our platform API and database. We’re not doing massive data analytics. Node showed us huge performance gains compared to what we were using before, which was Ruby on Rails.”
